Dark Souls 2 Save Swap
=========

A small script to make save swapping much easier on players farming or doing tough challenge runs.

Installation
--------------
```
-Have python version 2.7 installed on your local machine (https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.8/)
-Download all files from this repository
```

Setup
--------------
1. Figure out where dark souls 2 saves on your pc (google)
2. Figure out you user name. For example if the path is ***C:\Users\Alessandro\Downloads***, then my user name is ***Alessandro***
3. Open config.txt and enter you username in the appropiate area

Usage
--------------
1. Launch SaveSwap.py
- Use f1 - f4 to create saves
- Use f5 - f8 to load saves | ***f5 loads f1 slot, f6 loads f2 slots etc....***
- f9 is quick save, f10 is quick load

Notes
-----------------
- Saves can be made at any time.
- Loads **MUST** be made at the login screen before you select continue and choose a character
- If anything goes wrong during a session, manually use the MASTER save to overwrite your dks2 save.
- If you want to forget everything about save swap use the ORIGINAL save that is made the first time you ever launch my script to manually overwrite your dks2 save
